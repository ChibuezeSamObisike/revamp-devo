      "Is power good or evil? The answer is it depends on who has it.Jesus had power and he healed the sick and the oppressed. The Pharisees oppressed the people of their time with what little power they had. Power will be good or evil depending on who holds it. Just like Jesus said, a good tree will produce good fruit and a bad tree bad fruit.",

    body: "Is power bad? <br/> Should believers be afraid of power? <br/> <br/>  Matthew 7:17-18 NIV <br/> <br/> 17 Likewise every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. <br/> 18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.   <br/>  The text above has words directly from Jesus. He explains how a person's fruit serve as an indicator to the nature of thy individual. A bad tree will produce bad fruit and a good tree good fruit <br/> <br/>  What does this have to do with power? <br/> <br/> Let's look at what power is. <br/> Power is the ability to do work. If I have a plan, I need power to make my plan real.  Power serves as a tool to bring ideas to life. <br/>      Is power good or evil? The answer is it depends on who has it.   Jesus had power and he healed the sick and the oppressed. The Pharisees oppressed the people of their time with what little power they had.  <br/> <br/>  Power will be good or evil depending on who holds it.    Just like Jesus said, a good tree will produce good fruit and a bad tree bad fruit.   Power can be used for good and God has made believers powerful. He wants us to make the most of the power in us by walking in the spirit. When we follow God's desires, the heights we attain will not scare us to think we would becomenebil because God keeps our hearts.     <br/>   Power is not evil, it can be used for good, God wants the believer powerful for His plans to be fulfilled  <br/> <br/> Bible Study  <b> 2 Chronicles 17-19</b>",

    body: "Numbers 23:19 KJV <br/> <br/> God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? <br/> This is the most important statement in scripture as it clearly states God's faithfulness. It speaks of the consistency that the character of God has. <br/> <br/> God's word in James says that if any man does not err in speech, that man is perfect.(James 3:2)<br/>This goes to show the value truth has. Now think of it, the all powerful God tells no lies.<br/>He redefines to us what it means to be good. Anything God says is not a lie.<br/> <br/>A powerful reason why our anchor text matters so much is it gives us the confidence to trust the teachings of scripture because God doesn't lie. God validated scripture himself (2Timothy 3:16)Because of this, we can trust God's word.We can put our whole lives and our future on God's word and it will not fail.",
